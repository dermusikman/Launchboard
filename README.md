# launchboard

!!! This is pre-alpha, and not yet ready to be used.

## Goals

Launchboard (does not yet) mimic the functionality of the popular Novation Launchpad on a
computer keyboard. It (does not yet) support MIDI and OSC protocols.

Launchboard can be run in headless mode, with the ncurses interface, or tied
to a GUI.

## TODO

1. Complete basic OSC/MIDI functionality - maybe 20% of the way there.
2. Create the ncurses interface for it.
